# BombSolver
### Defusing bombs in Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes using Image Analysis and Machine Learning

### Usage
1. Install Anaconda (or Miniconda).
2. Activate the conda environment using `conda activate tens_gpu`.
3. Launch `Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes` (KTANE).
4. Select a level within the game, but do not press `Start`.
5. Run `python main.py` in the root directory.
6. Press S while in the summary window of the selected KTANE level.
7. The level will now start and the program will do it's magic.
**_Note:_** Not usable yet, as the classifier model is not on Git yet (it will in the future, hopefully).
